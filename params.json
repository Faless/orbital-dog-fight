After building the desired templates compress\r\nthem into a '.zip' file and change the extension to `.tpz`.\r\n\r\nThe templates can be directly imported into the editor by clicking `Settings ->\r\nInstall Export Templates`\r\n\r\nClone this repository `git clone\r\nhttps://github.com/Palli-Moon/orbital-dog-fight.git` and import the project into\r\ngodot.
